Designed to take basic machine code for NIOS 2 and convert write the data into a .mif file so the processor loaded onto the FPGA board can run it.


Instructions to run:
Rewrite MemoryInitialization.txt with your own file and the run the shortcut.
The shortcut works, by giving the filename as a argument to the program, which will make a .mif file using this given name.
